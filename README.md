# Dynamix DNS Client for Linux
Official client for https://dynamix.run

## Dynamic DNS
Dynamix (https://dynamix.run) offers free Dynamic DNS services with subdomain and custom domain support. Run your servers off of your residential internet connection. Have a dynamic IP address? No problem, you can still run servers without a static IP address. Be free and do what you want with your internet!

## Synchronization
The Dynamix DNS Client bash script is our official open source synchronization tool for Linux. Dynamix DNS Client scans for IP address changes and uses our API to update your dynamic DNS records minimizing any potential downtime an IP address change might cause.  When an IP address change is detected, selected dynamic DNS hosts are updated to point to your latest IP address.  Run this application on your Linux server.
